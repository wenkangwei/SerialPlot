<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
When doing some projects involving signal measurement such as voltage  signal, sensorsâ€™ data, we usually need an oscilloscope to visualize and analyize those data. However, such kind of devices are expensive for me.  Thus, why not develop an application using some cheap devices (Arduino for example) by myself?</li>
<li>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
In this project, i use an Arduino UNO board and Qt GUI platform to build a voltage viewer, where Arduino collects the voltage signal using ADC and sends the data by USART simply and QT GUI program manages and displays the dataset.<br>
In Qt GUI application, its functions are following:
<ul>
<li>ADC channel selection</li>
<li>Sample time selection</li>
<li>Axes range changing</li>
<li>Waveform review</li>
</ul>
</li>
